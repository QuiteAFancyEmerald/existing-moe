# existing.moe 
The one and only legendary anime discord bot with over 90 but two commands! This project was mostly a joke project I made for the Titanium Network community but I still maintain it. The source code is beyond cursed.

### Setup:
Paste your discord bot token inside `.env.example` and remove the `.example` extension then run the commands below.


```
git clone https://github.com/QuiteAFancyEmerald/existing.moe
cd existing.moe
npm install
npm start

### Recommended to use pm2
npm install -g pm2
npm start ecosystem.config.js --env production
pm2 status
```

### Configuration:

Configuration is made easy via `config.json`:

```
{
    "botClientID": "",
    "ownerID": "",
    "embedColor": "#250c3a",
    "embedfooterText": "existing.moe - v1.6.2 -"
}
```
